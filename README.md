# Baader.hu personal public site

My personal website uses a Tailwind UI template, which was built using Tailwind CSS and Next.js.

WIP:
- missing mainly all blogpost etc


## Getting started

To get started with this template, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Next, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` variable to your site's public URL:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.


## License

You can't use any part of this commercially, based on Tailwind UI license.
